# myfirstfizzbuzz
My first fizzbuzz. 

Fizzbuzzes up to 1 million.

Took me a very long time- I'm very proud, view fizzbuzz.py raw for details

# fizzbuzz_extended
Fizzbuzzes up to 10 million now!

Works exactly the same as regular fizzbuzz except it gets around the issue of github only accepting <100mb files by importing! See fizzbuzz_imports

Interestingly, python does not like a lot of elif statements- it would segfault if I tried to import and run them- so, I changed them all to if statements!
